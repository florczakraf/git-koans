# Git Koans

## Usage
Fill in the tasks in `git-koans/git-koans.py` and run:
```bash
$ ./enlighten.sh
```

To increase the verbosity of the output, use:
```python
koan.verbose = True
```
inside the assignment. For example, it will print the actual paths used during execution instead of `.` so you can 
verify everything yourself when something goes west.

## Requirements:
`git` in `PATH` and all the python packages from `requirements.txt`. You can get the latter with `pip`:
```bash
[sudo] pip install -r requirements.txt
```
